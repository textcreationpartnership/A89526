         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Beleeve that you have ſeen the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Committee of Eſtates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the late Engagement, being (as I underſtand) ſent from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by the laſt Poſt, ſo that I need not acquaint you therewith. Divers of our Souldiers have lately had particular injuries offered to them, by being ſet upon in the high-wayes, and other places, by ſome looſe and deſperate perſons, in this kingdome. Many of their horſes have been taken away, ſtolne, &amp;c. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and truely there is ſuch watchings, and way-laying of us, that wee dare not ſtirre without a good company together, nor then neither without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cock't and prim'd, and reſolute to meet with ſome encounter, before we come to our journeys end. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, 6 of Major Gen. <hi>Lamberts</hi> Regiment, with one Quarter-maſter <hi>Dimond,</hi> that commanded them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162351:3"/>were ſet upon by 14 or 15 of theſe Rogues, at the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the Evening, within 2 miles of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the other as ſoon as they diſcovered ours to be <hi>Engliſh</hi> having the advantage of their ſwords ready drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their cloaks, imediately fel upon them with ſword and Piſtoll, ours not much unready, nor turning their backes becauſe of their number, preſently fell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves, they fought with them about a quarter of an houre, laid three of them ſprawling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, wounded moſt of the reſt, routed them and came off without any hurt, ſave onely their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Armes were ſoundly wounded, and one that had a cut on his hand.</p>
            <p>Many of the like happen, but our men being now upon their conſtant watch ſeldome come off with the worſt, you ſee in what danger notwithſtanding wee are in by ſuch private lurking Enemies as theſe are. Nevertheleſſe the Committee of Eſtates have taken theſe things into conſideration, and uſed meanes to give ſatisfaction to all our loſſes in this kind, and to prevent the like for the future, as by the incloſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you will perceive, which hath given us ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>But we hope our ſtay here will not be long now, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14 dayes may give us a diſmiſſion, though thoſe that are well affected to this Committee of Eſtates are jealous that the Malignant party watch but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity of our departure and then to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again, and that is the cauſe that by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our preſence the Committee of Eſtates think fit to put themſelves into a poſture of defence by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing a ſtanding force for the ſuppreſſing &amp; keeping
